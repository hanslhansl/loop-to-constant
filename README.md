# loop-to-constant
This repository provides an algorithm for transforming certain for loops into equivalent code with constant time complexity.
Currently, it can parse Python code and output the transformed code in Python and C++.
## Motivation
Both in mathematics 
$\sum_{i=a}^{b} i$
as well as in programming it is sometimes necessary to compute a sum over a range:

## Performance
### Time complexity
### Runtime
## Performance of the algorithm itself
